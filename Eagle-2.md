# Project Eagle

This feature is being developed to understand our audience. 
- Which geography they belong to?
- What type of device and browsers they use to visit?
- Which pages they visit and when?
- Website engagement over time?

## Plan
1. Understand the log format/structure in aws
2. Create a table with useful/important features using the log files
3. Look up the IP address for location and append it to the table as a feature
4. Create a visualisation to summarise contents of the table


### Log Format

### Important Features

### Geolocation 

### Visualisation
